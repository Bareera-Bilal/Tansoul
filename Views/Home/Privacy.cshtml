        <h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

        <p>At <strong>TanSoul</strong>, we understand how personal and sensitive healthcare information is. This privacy
            policy outlines how we protect your data, what we collect, and how your experience on our platform remains
            secure, transparent, and respectful.</p>

        <h4>1. Information We Collect</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal:</strong> Full name, email address, contact number, gender, date of birth, and profile
                photo.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical:</strong> Symptoms submitted, health concerns, appointment logs, treatment notes,
                prescriptions, and uploaded files (e.g. test results, scans).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical:</strong> IP address, browser type, operating system, login history, and usage
                patterns such as page views and button clicks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. How We Use Data</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To connect patients with the right doctors based on specialization and availability.</li>
            <li>To offer appointment scheduling, reminders, and post-consultation care instructions.</li>
            <li>To improve the performance, security, and relevance of our platform services.</li>
            <li>To personalize health suggestions and display important updates related to care.</li>
            <li>To enhance customer support and troubleshoot account-related concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Data Protection</h4>
        <p>We employ advanced encryption technologies and multi-layered authentication to secure all data exchanges on
            our platform. Sensitive medical records are protected by secure access controls, regular audits, and data
            minimization principles to reduce unnecessary storage of personal health information.</p>

        <h4>4. Sharing Information</h4>
        <p>Your data is never sold or misused. We only share your information with qualified healthcare professionals
            you choose to consult. In cases of legal obligations or urgent health-related circumstances, data may be
            disclosed under appropriate safeguards.</p>

        <h4>5. Your Rights</h4>
        <p>You have full control over your data. You may request to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access your consultation history and personal details.</li>
            <li>Update contact information or correct any inaccuracies.</li>
            <li>Delete your account and request removal of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Simply contact our support team and we will process your request in a timely and secure manner.</p>

        <h4>6. Policy Updates</h4>
        <p>We may occasionally revise this Privacy Policy to comply with new regulations or improve clarity. All updates
            will be posted on this page. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically to stay informed.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Financial Policies</h4>
        <p><strong>For Patients:</strong> We believe in fair and transparent billing. If you cancel your appointment at
            least <strong>2 hours in advance</strong>, your consultation fee is fully refundable. Refunds are initiated
            within 24 hours and processed to your original payment method within 5–7 business days. For cancellations
            after the 2-hour window or no-shows, refunds may not be applicable.</p>

        <p><strong>For Doctors:</strong> To ensure the continued growth and maintenance of our platform, a service fee
            of <strong>10%</strong> is deducted from each successful consultation. This deduction supports
            infrastructure costs, secure data handling, and 24/7 technical support. Doctors can view detailed earnings
            and deductions in their payout dashboard.</p>

        <h4>8. Third-Party Services</h4>
        <p>We may integrate with external services such as payment gateways, prescription fulfillment partners, or
            analytics providers. These services are carefully selected, and we ensure they follow strict privacy and
            security standards. However, their individual policies apply once you leave our platform.</p>

        <h4>9. Children’s Privacy</h4>
        <p>Our platform is designed for users aged 18 and above. If we learn that we have collected data from a child
            under legal age without verified guardian consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information.
        </p>

        <p>If you have any concerns or require clarification on any part of this policy, you may reach out to us
            anytime.</p>
